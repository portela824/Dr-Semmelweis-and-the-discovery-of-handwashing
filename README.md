# Dr-Semmelweis-and-the-discovery-of-handwashing-Project-1-Jose-G-Portela
# This project was made thanks to data camp and in line 3 I provide the link to the project in Datacamp 
# https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/discovery-of-handwashing/guided/Python

# Even though I did it in Python there is an option to do it in the statistical programming language R

# I first made the project on the Datacamp website after that I uploaded  into google colaboratory and then uploaded into Github

# Something interesting about the project is how something so simple as washing hands during the end of the nineteenth century make an important impact
on people healths.

# For me realizing this project help me understand a litle more on how to use Python or R on possible future projects or even create an idea of how 
the job od a Data Scientis is
